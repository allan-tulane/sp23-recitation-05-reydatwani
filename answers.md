Quicksort has a runtime complexity of O(n log n). Selection sort has a runtime complexity of O(n^2). Quicksort is much faster and more efficient than selection sort. The more inputs you have in the input list, the more efficient quicksort is compared to selection sort. For example if the input list = 1000, it would take selection sort 1,000,000 operations versus onl 10,000 for quicksort.

Timsort has a runtime complexity of O(n log n) which is the same as quicksort and mergesort which are both highly efficient. Timsort is similar to mergesort. What makes quicksort better is that it is shorter to write and takes up less memory space. Timsort's worst case runtime is also worse than quicksort's worse case runtime.
